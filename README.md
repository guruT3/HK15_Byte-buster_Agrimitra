## 📌 Overview

**Agri Mitra** is an AI-powered smart farming platform designed to bridge the gap between fragmented agricultural data and real, actionable guidance for farmers. By combining crop prediction, disease detection, real-time weather forecasting, market price analysis, and multilingual AI support into a single ecosystem, Agri Mitra empowers farmers to make data-driven decisions every day.

---

## 🚜 Problem Statement

Agriculture supports over 58% of India's population, yet farmers — especially the 80% who are small and marginal — lack access to real-time digital decision support. Critical challenges include:

- Unpredictable weather patterns affecting crop planning
- Rapid spread of crop diseases without early detection
- Volatile market prices and poor market access
- Fragmented apps offering isolated, incomplete solutions

**There is a clear need for a unified, AI-driven system that converts raw farm data into simple, explainable daily action plans.**

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Agri Mitra processes farmer inputs (soil data, location, crop images, and specific requirements) through a suite of AI/ML models and delivers personalized recommendations and action plans.

**Technology Stack:**
- Machine Learning models for crop prediction
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for disease detection (99%+ accuracy)
- Real-time Weather API integration
- Market Data Analytics for price trend prediction
- Multilingual AI Chatbot (Hindi, Odia, Telugu, and more)

**Flow:**
```
Farmer Input → AI Processing (ML Models + APIs) → Personalized Recommendation & Action Plan → Improved Productivity & Profit
```
